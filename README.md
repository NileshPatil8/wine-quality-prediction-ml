# wine-quality-prediction-ml
This project predicts the quality of wine (red or white) using chemical features such as acidity, sugar, pH, chlorides, sulphates, and alcohol. The goal is to build a reliable regression model that can accurately estimate wine quality scores based on measurable chemical properties.
